# Task Management App with Next.js (typescript) and Redux Toolkit

## Overview

The task management app is a web application constructed using cutting-edge tools in the field, including the Next.js React framework and Redux for state management. Its purpose is to address a spectrum of web development aspects such as React hooks, integrating Redux toolkit, navigation with Next router, managing component lifecycles, Optimization and implementing server-side rendering (SSR).

On the first page, the app allows users to create active tasks, toggle them as complete once finished, and delete them if necessary. 
Moving to the second page, it performs an asynchronous action by making an API call request using server-side rendering (SSR), and subsequently renders the retrieved data, including the title and image.
